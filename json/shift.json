This session aims to provide an introduction to KSP and its benefits compared to the Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool (KAPT).\n\nThe practical portion of this talk will guide you through the process of creating annotation definitions and implementing a symbol processor. We will demonstrate the usage of KSP API and KotlinPoet for generating Kotlin files, providing you with a hands-on experience of working with KSP. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how to use KSP in multiplatform projects.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will walk away with a solid understanding of Kotlin Symbol Processing, and practical knowledge on how to leverage KSP in your development workflow.",
