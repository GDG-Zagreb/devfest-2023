I'll guide you through building a small Android app that uses Koog to ask a language model for weather forecasts and then displays the results. We'll cover:\n\n• How to add Koog to an Android project setup\n• How to write a simple single-run agent that talks to a weather API\n• How to connect the agent to an LLM (like OpenAI or Google Gemini)\n• How to show the forecast in a basic Compose UI\n\nNo prior experience with Koog is needed. By the end you will have a simple working Android app and code that shows how to build your own agents in Kotlin.",
